The number of available rows and columns in the tile's\n * level is given with [[rowCount]]() and [[columnCount]]().\n *\n * Tile keys can be created from and converted into various alternative formats:\n *\n *  - [[toQuadKey]]() / [[fromQuadKey]]() - string representation 4-based\n *  - [[toHereTile]]() / [[fromHereTile]]() - string representation 10-based\n *  - [[mortonCode]]() / [[fromMortonCode]]() - number representation\n *\n * Note - as JavaScript's number type can hold 53 bits in its mantissa, only levels up to 26 can be\n * represented in the number representation returned by [[mortonCode]]().\n */\nexport class TileKey {\n    /**\n     * Creates a tile key.\n     *\n     * @param row The requested row.
